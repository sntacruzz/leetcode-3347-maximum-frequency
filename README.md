### üìò Overview
This repository contains clean implementations (C++ and Python) for the **LeetCode 3347** problem:  
**‚ÄúMaximum Frequency of an Element After Performing Operations II.‚Äù**

---

## üß© Problem
You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `numOperations`.  
Each operation picks an index not chosen before and adds an integer in range `[-k, k]` to that element.  
You must perform `numOperations` operations.  
Return the **maximum possible frequency** of any element in `nums` after the operations.

---

## üí° Approach
Sort + candidate enumeration + binary search.  
Try candidates `nums[i]`, `nums[i]-k`, and `nums[i]+k` (deduplicated).  
For each candidate `m`, compute the window of elements that can reach `m` using binary search on sorted `nums`.  

Formula:
f(m) = min(window_size, freq[m] + numOperations)
